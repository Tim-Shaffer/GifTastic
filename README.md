## Tech Used

## Default Page - index.html
* Link directly to the page here:  https://tim-shaffer.github.io/GifTastic/

## Instructions
1. There is an array populated to contain an initial group of topics as a starting point for the functionality.
    1. Looney Tunes Cartoon Characters are used for the topic.
1. Opening the default page will take the topics in the array and create buttons.
1. When the user clicks on a button, the page will grab 10 static, non-animated gif images from the GIPHY API and place them on the page.
1. When the user clicks one of the still GIPHY images, the gif will animate and if the user clicks the gif again, it will stop playing.
1. Under every gif, the rating that is returned from the GIPHY API is displayed.
1. A form is available on the page to allow the user to add more Cartoon Characters.
    1. When the user clicks the **Add New** button or hits enter, the new topic is added to the initial array and the page is updated with a new button to correspond to the new topic.
